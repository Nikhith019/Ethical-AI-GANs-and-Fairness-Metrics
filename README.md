## Explanation of tasks

1. GAN Architecture: Adversarial Process

Description: In GANs, the Generator creates fake data, and the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. The goal is for the 
Generator to produce data so realistic that the Discriminator canâ€™t tell the difference.

2. Application Example & Mitigation Strategies

Description: Generative models like chatbots can spread harmful advice. Solutions like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and real-
time fact-checking can help mitigate risks.

3. GAN Implementation in PyTorch

Description: This code trains a GAN in PyTorch on the MNIST dataset, where the Generator creates fake images, and the Discriminator classifies 
them as real or fake, visualizing generated samples.

4. Poisoning in Text Classification

Description: A text classification model is trained on both clean and poisoned data (altered labels for "UC Berkeley"). The impact of poisoned 
data on model performance is evaluated.

5. Ethical Issues in AI

Description: Discusses ethical concerns about AI memorizing private data and generating copyrighted content, suggesting data restrictions to 
protect privacy and intellectual property.

6. Fairness Metric: False Negative Rate Parity

Description: False Negative Rate Parity (FNRP) checks if a model's false negatives are equally distributed across groups (e.g., gender, race), 
ensuring fairness and equity in sensitive domains like healthcare.
